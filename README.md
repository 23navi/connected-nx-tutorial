# Connected: A Social Network Analysis Tutorial with NetworkX
Repository for code and notebooks for the NetworkX Tutorial

## Requirements
If you've obtained python through Anaconda, you should be set. In essence, we need Python 3 and the conda package manager.

- [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
  - Python 3
  - Conda package manager
- Packages listed below

This is an intermediate level tutorial, so we expect  prior knowledge of:
- Python types & data structures
- Installing python packages through `pip` or `conda`
- Data Science Packages:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib


### Packages and Environment
A Conda Environment is used to organize packages and their correct versions. Package details are contained in the `environment.yaml` file included. To create an environment with conda use:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
